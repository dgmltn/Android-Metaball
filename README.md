## Summary

A metaball "current page" indicator. AKA ViewPagerIndicator. These metaballs act like water droplets with surface tension. Physics FTW!

This library was heavily inspired by [previous work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dodola/MetaballLoading/master/app/src/main/java/com/dodola/animview/MetaballView.java). Open Source FTW!
